# Overview:

Experiment 4 used a slower periodic rate than experiment 3, with the rest of the experiment remaining unchanged. The rate used, a 2 Hz periodic rhythm (IOI of 500 ms), was selected during piloting because it was comfortable to track and attend to. It was also half the frequency of that used in experiment 3 and is slower than the average IOI of 396.15 ms used by the studies reported the table review in the chapter 5 introduction.
It was hypothesised that there would be little difference between experiments 3 and 4 apart from the effects of periodicity being more pronounced and perhaps affecting choice accuracy. This was hypothesised for two reasons: Firstly, a 2 Hz rate is slow enough to avoid the inhibiting effects of the decision refractory described by Wyart 2012 from influencing sequence processing. Secondly, 2 Hz is close to the preferred tempo reported by Moelants (2002) and the average rates of a range of natural movements. For this reason the lateralized stimuli should have been easier to locate, process and respond to.

# Requirements:

MATLAB (MathWorks) - the program was build in version R2015b. Psychtoolbox3 (http://psychtoolbox.org/) - version 3.0.13 - Flavor: beta - Corresponds to SVN Revision 8038.

# Installation:

Clone the respository to a local folder and set MATLABs current directory to the selected folder. Enter 'averaging_threshold' into the MATLAB terminal to start the experiment. Be sure to change any hard coded URLs in ‘averaging_threshold’ to represent the folder directory of your computer.
