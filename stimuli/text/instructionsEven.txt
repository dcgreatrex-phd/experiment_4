On each trial you will hear a moving sound sequence followed by a comparison tone.\n\nYour task is to say whether the average spatial location of the moving sequence is to \nthe left or right of the comparison tone using the response keys. \n\nIn the practice session you will receive visual feedback to help you: \nA white dot will appear on screen at the same time and in the same spatial location \nas the comparison tone. Once you respond, either a green or red line will \nappear on screen marking the average location of the moving sequence. \nIf the line is green, your are correct, if it is red, you are incorrect.\n\n\n\nClick to continue...
We shall begin with a practice session. \n\n\n\nRemember: Your task is to say whether the average spatial location of the moving \nsound sequence is to the left or right of the comparison tone.\n\n On each trial it is important that you keep your index finger on the middle key "5" \nuntil you hear the comparison tone. You then respond by pressing \nthe key that is above or below. \n\nYou press UP for Left and DOWN for Right as soon \nas you hear the comparison tone \n\n\n\nClick the mouse to have a go...
Now try doing the task without feedback. \n\nThe only difference is that you will no longer see the white dot \nor coloured visual cues on screen.
In the next stage the computer will do some configration. The session will start off \nvery easy and get progressively harder as you progress. \n\nDo not worry if at any point you find the task too hard. Just really focus \non trying to make the most accurate judgements as possible. \n\nThe session last ~ 5 mins and will end once it has collected enough data. \n\n\n\nClick to continue...
Ok, we are about the start the configuration stage. \n\n\n\nRemember: Your task is to say whether the average spatial location of the moving sound \nsequence is to the left or right of the comparison tone.\n\nYou respond by pressing either up (left) or down (right) from a resting position of key "5" \n and can respond as soon as you hear the comparison tone.\n\n\n\nClick the mouse to begin...
You have now completed the practice and configuration so we can now \nstart the main experiment. \n\nBefore we begin take a short break so that you do not get too tired \nin the experiment. It is ok to take your headphones off. \n\n\n\nClick the mouse to continue when you are ready...
The main experiment contains exactly the same task as in the previous \ntwo sessions. \n\nThis time however you will find that the task difficulty has been tailored to \nyour own ability. You should therefore find the task to be a challenge, \nbut not too easy, nor too hard.\n\nThe experiment contains 6 blocks of trials. Each block lasts around 7 minutes \nand is followed by a short break.\n\n\n\nClick to continue...
